# Install flux

To install flux manually, we'll use the flux cli.

```bash
flux bootstrap github --owner=kalioz --repository=fluxv2-demo --path=environments/minikube/dev
```

You should now see ressources appear in your kubernetes cluster in the `flux-system` namespace;
You should also see in your repo the flux components appear in the `environments/minikube/dev/flux-system` repository.

> If you badly installed flux, you can restart the bootstrap command using the `flux uninstall` to cleanup the previous ressources.

> You can also install flux using terraform.

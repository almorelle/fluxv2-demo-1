# Install flux in the cluster

We'll start by installing flux in your cluster. To do so, we'll use the flux CLI, which will in a single command create the CRDs & the operator, and prepare an initial git repository to be synced with the cluster.

```bash
OWNER="kalioz" # replace by your github username
flux bootstrap github --owner="${OWNER}" --repository=fluxv2-demo --path=environments/minikube/dev
```

  <summary>Expected output</summary>

```bash
$ flux bootstrap github --owner="${OWNER}" --repository=fluxv2-demo --path=environments/minikube/dev

</details>

With this command, we've : 
- install the flux CRD and operator on the cluster
- created on the cluster two Kubernetes objects : a GitRepo linked to `github.com/kalioz/fluxv2-demo` and a Kustomization on the folder `environments/minikube/dev` of the precedent GitRepo.
- written to the `github.com/kalioz/fluxv2-demo` repository the flux objects in the `environments/minikube/dev/flux-system` folder. As this folder is included in the `environments/minikube/dev` path, it is included in the synchronization done by Flux.

You should now see ressources appear in your kubernetes cluster in the `flux-system` namespace;
```bash
$ kubectl get po -n flux-system
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
helm-controller-97cb7b49f-wt5h2            1/1     Running   0          2m6s
kustomize-controller-684ccd454b-kkkp2      1/1     Running   0          2m6s
notification-controller-79c746b8c4-w7b9m   1/1     Running   0          2m6s
source-controller-54dcdb4744-ljmbj         1/1     Running   0          2m6s
```

You should also see in your repo the flux components appear in the `environments/minikube/dev/flux-system` repository.
```bash
$ ls -lh environments/minikube/dev/flux-system
Permissions Size User      Date Modified  Name
.rw-rw-r--  259k cloiselet 28 juil. 21:59 gotk-components.yaml
.rw-rw-r--   564 cloiselet 28 juil. 22:30 gotk-sync.yaml
.rw-rw-r--   115 cloiselet 28 juil. 22:01 kustomization.yaml
```

> If you badly installed flux (misconfiguration), you can restart the bootstrap command using the `flux uninstall` to cleanup the previous ressources.

> You can also [install flux using terraform](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/#bootstrap-with-terraform).

You should now have your github repository ready to deploy changes to your cluster.

## More information on the topology

We're using the topology `environments/<provider>/<environment-name>` as it is easy to manage with kustomize when you start having multiple environments and cloud providers. 

On the final repository, we expect to have this topology using kustomize :

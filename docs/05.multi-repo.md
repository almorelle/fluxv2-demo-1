# Multi-repo setup

We've seen how to administer a monorepo, where you declared all your ressources for all your cluster in the same place.
This is great for an easy setup, but what if you wanted to keep the configuration files next to the application's code ?

Flux handles the syncronisation with `GitRepo` and `Kustomization`; if you want to add another repo to the flux synchronisation, all you have to do is add a `GitRepo` and a `Kustomization` file in the "root" repository (the first repo that we've set up), pointing to the second repository.

As far as flux is concerned, the second repo synchronisation will behave as the root repository, with the same rights and restrictions. This is useful if your team manages multiple repositories sharing the same permission scope (for example, "application-backend" & "application-frontend").

However, if you want to restrict the rights of the second repository (e.g., restricted to a single namespace), then you'll need to use a multi-tenancy setup which will garantee this, using different service accounts with restricted (or priviledged) rights.

There are multiple ways to organize a multi-repo infrastructure :
- one repo per environment (enables to have better protections on the production repos)
- one repo per team, managing multiple applications / components
- one repo per application, where the application's code is next to the deployment manifests.

Once you have chosen your organization structure, you can now start linking the other repositories to flux :
As we said previously, flux uses `GitRepo` and `Kustomization` CRDs to configure the syncronisation between the repos and Kustomize; we'll need to add new ones for each one of the repos we want to add as tenant.


We'll test one of the most used form of multi-repo: one git repository per application.

## How to do it

First, we'll add a `GitRepo` pointing to the new repository, using a flux command :
```bash
flux create source git secondary-flux-repo \
   --url=ssh://git@github.com/kalioz/fluxv2-demo-tenant-repo.git \
   --branch=main
   # --export
```

Flux will ask you to add a deploy key to the repository. You can do so following these instructions : https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys.

1) access to https://github.com/kalioz/fluxv2-demo-tenant-repo/settings/keys to add the key
2) add the deploy key to your github repo
3) finalize the command (answer 'y').

which should add to your cluster the following elements, in the `flux-system` namespace :
```
gitrepo/secondary-flux-repo
secret/secondary-flux-repo
```

Let's now add those file to your main repo, so they can be tracked using flux.

First, let's add the gitrepo :
```yaml
# kubectl get gitrepo -n flux-system secondary-flux-repo -oyaml > environments/minikube/dev/tenants/secondary-repo/gitrepo.yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: secondary-flux-repo
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  gitImplementation: go-git
  interval: 1m0s
  ref:
    branch: main
  secretRef:
    name: secondary-flux-repo
  timeout: 60s
  url: ssh://git@github.com/kalioz/fluxv2-demo-tenant-repo.git
```

Then, let's add the secret;
As it is a secret, we don't want to store it in clear in the git repo; ideally, it would be stored using a smart client (e.g. Vault), capable of rotating the secret, instead of as code.

We'll use our previously installed sealed-secret server to encode the secret :
```bash
# download the secret locally
kubectl get secret -n flux-system secondary-flux-repo -oyaml > secret.yaml
# encode the secret using the installed sealed-secrets configuration
cat secret.yaml | kubeseal --controller-name sealed-secrets --controller-namespace default -oyaml > encode-secret.yaml
```
which should give you a file similar to this one :
```yaml
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: secondary-flux-repo
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  encryptedData:
    identity: AgAYs5kYLlaXWx2Vu+y8CAPTVxjezLodC1oB48tR924Q+sLTFtGF3C2rkCt7xK5qLwEqtdG26UkvXpyu5+YggbU1sYHGWcb52H

    IMzTseGDAfd2RKDvl09AZMqmIg3FN7RLNAJR7eBGFvdzQO9Kh/L03SUqkFtPJo=
  template:
    data: null
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      name: secondary-flux-repo
      namespace: flux-system
    type: Opaque
```

add this file to your main flux repo and remove the current secret & gitrepo; it should be recreated using flux, and sealed-secrets.

You now need to add a Kustomization file to point to a folder in the new gitrepo; we'll monitor `deploy/dev` to stay in the spirit of an application's repository.

```yaml
# cat environments/minikube/dev/tenants/secondary-repo/kustomization-flux.yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: secondary-flux-repo
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1m0s
  path: ./deploy/dev
  prune: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: secondary-flux-repo
```


You should now have two repositories managed by flux; try adding some ressources in the second repository :
```yaml
# cat deploy/dev/hello-world-deployment.yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world-secondary-repo
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This should be deployed alongside our current "hello-world" application.

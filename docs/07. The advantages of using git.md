# The advantages of using git to store your deployment files

We've talked a lot about HOW to deploy using flux; let's see now WHY deploying using flux (or any gitops solution) is better than other solutions.

## Single source of truth & Reconciliation loop

Flux uses the git repos as single source of truth, like a lot of other simili "gitops" solution. However, it also includes a reconciliation loop, that will force the cluster to be in the state defined in the git even if there has been manual changes; a simple pipeline wouldn't be able to achieve this level of control over the cluster.

## Pre-commit tools

You can add pre-commit tools that will validate your files before they are even pushed to the remote server; We recommend the following ones :
- yaml
- kustomize

## Linting & Build Pipelines

You can also add some check pipelines on your pull requests to ensure they are valid and conforming to your rules;
At minimal, you should have both a yaml linter and kustomize builder to ensure your code is valid; validating the Kubernetes ressources will be a good additional step, though it can be hard to juggle between CRDs versions.

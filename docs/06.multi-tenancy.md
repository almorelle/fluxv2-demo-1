# Multi-tenancy

We've seen how to administer a monorepo, where you declared all your ressources for all your cluster in the same place.
We've also seen how to administer a multi-repo, enabling you to spread the configurations across different repositories.
This is great for an easy setup, but what if you wanted to have a fine-grained control over who can modify which component ? In the current multi-repo setup, the "secondary-repo" has the same rights as the root repositories, which is too great for a simple application repository.

That's where the multitenancy setup comes into place.

> A multi-tenancy setup is not equal to a multi-repo architecture; you can use flux on a multi-repo arch with a single tenant, simply by adding a GitRepo and an associated Kustomization file.

## Add a tenant

```bash
flux create tenant secondary-flux-repo \
    --with-namespace=apps \
    --export > environments/minikube/dev/tenants/secondary-repo/tenant.yaml
```

Now, create / change the namespaces of the objects created for the tenant to `app-secondary-tenant`;

```bash
flux create source git secondary-flux-repo \
    --namespace=apps \
    --url=https://github.com/<org>/<dev-team> \
    --branch=main \
    --export > environments/minikube/dev/tenants/secondary-repo/gitrepo.yaml
# note: we're using public https in order to go faster; you should set up the connexion using ssh, sealed-secrets & a private repo in a production env.

flux create kustomization secondary-flux-repo \
    --namespace=apps \
    --target-namespace=apps \
    --service-account=secondary-flux-repo \
    --source=GitRepository/secondary-flux-repo \
    --path="./deploy/dev" \
    --export > environments/minikube/dev/tenants/secondary-repo/kustomization-flux.yaml
```

The tenant permissions will be defined by the serviceaccount apps/secondary-flux-repo, who for now is admin on the apps namespace. You can restrict these rights (e.g. only allow some ressources to be created) or expand them as you want.

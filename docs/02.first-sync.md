# first sync

we'll now add a simple object to our cluster, to see it synchronize.
We'll create the file `environments/minikube/dev/applications/hello-world/hello-world-deployment.yaml` and add a deployment in it.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

we'll now add this file to git, and commit it to the main branch.
You should now see the application appear in the default namespace :) 

Take a look at the structure of the `deploy` that has been created :
- two labels `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/[name,namespace]` exists
- the annotation used by kubectl for manual deployments isn't present

Now, try to edit manually the deployment, for example to increase the number of replicas present : 
```bash
kubectl scale deployment --replicas 5 nginx-deployment
```
The deployment will be scaled up until the next reconciliation, which should happen under 10m for a default installation.

If you want your manual edits to stay, you'll need to use the cli to edit the ressource and pause it : 
```bash
kubectl annotate deploy/nginx-deployment kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/reconcile=disabled
```

To resume the reconciliation on the ressource : 
```bash
kubectl annotate deploy/nginx-deployment kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/reconcile-
```

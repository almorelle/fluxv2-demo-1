# Multi-tenancy

We've seen how to administer a monorepo, where you declared all your ressources for all your cluster in the same place.
This is great for an easy setup, but what if you wanted to have a fine-grained control over who can modify which component ?

That's where the multitenancy setup comes into place.

There are multiple ways to organize a multitenancy : 
- one repo per team, managing multiple applications / components
- one repo per application, where the application's code is next to the deployment manifests. 

Once you have chosen your organization structure, you can now start linking the other repositories to flux : 
As we said previously, flux uses `GitRepo` and `Kustomization` CRDs to configure the syncronisation between the repos and Kustomize; we'll need to add new ones for each one of the repos we want to add as tenant.

You will need to create other GitRepo and Kustomization pointing to the other repositories. Moreover, in order to restrict your tenants rights and protect the cluster, we'll add some Kyverno rules.

# Multi tenancy and Kyverno

Multi tenancy brings a whole load of rights problems to solve.
You can restrict the actions a tenant can do with rbac (for example, only allowing him to access pods and not PVC), but there will come a time you may want to enforce stricter rules, like for example ensure everyone set pods ressources requests & limits correctly.

[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) can help on this topic ! It is an admission controller that will check every manfiest sent to kubernetes and validate them against a set of rules you've defined.

You can configure it to enforce or only audit the cluster.

Let's install Kyverno first :

```yaml
# cat environments/minikube/dev/applications/kyverno/kyverno-helmrepository.yaml
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: kyverno
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1h
  url: https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno/

```

```yaml
# cat environments/minikube/dev/applications/kyverno/kyverno-helmrelease.yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: kyverno
  namespace: default
spec:
  interval: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: kyverno
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: kyverno
        namespace: flux-system
      interval: 1m
  values:
```

Now, let's create a policy to enforce our rules :
```yaml
# cat environments/minikube/dev/applications/kyverno/clusterpolicy-resources.yaml
---
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: all-containers-need-requests-and-limits
spec:
  validationFailureAction: audit # set to `enforce` to block the ressource creation if it doesn't match the rule
  rules:
  - name: check-container-resources
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
    validate:
      message: "All containers must have CPU and memory resource requests and limits defined."
      pattern:
        spec:
          containers:
          # Select all containers in the pod. The `name` field here is not specifically required but serves
          # as a visual aid for instructional purposes.
          - name: "*"
            resources:
              limits:
                # '?' requires 1 alphanumeric character and '*' means that
                # there can be 0 or more characters. Using them together
                # e.g. '?*' requires at least one character.
                memory: "?*"
              requests:
                memory: "?*"
                cpu: "?*"
```

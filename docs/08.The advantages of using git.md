# The advantages of using git to store your deployment files

We've talked a lot about HOW to deploy using flux; let's see now WHY deploying using flux (or any gitops solution) is better than other solutions.

## Single source of truth & Reconciliation loop

Flux uses the git repos as single source of truth, like a lot of other simili "gitops" solution. However, it also includes a reconciliation loop, that will force the cluster to be in the state defined in the git even if there has been manual changes; a simple pipeline wouldn't be able to achieve this level of control over the cluster.

## Pre-commit tools

You can add pre-commit tools that will validate your files before they are even pushed to the remote server; We recommend the following ones :
- yaml
- kustomize

Using the `pre-commit` framework, you can end up with this kind of pre-commit hook :

```yaml
# cat .pre-commit-config.yaml
---
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.3.0
    hooks:
    - id: trailing-whitespace
    - id: end-of-file-fixer
    - id: debug-statements
    - id: double-quote-string-fixer
    - id: name-tests-test
    - id: requirements-txt-fixer
  - repo: https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint.git
    rev: v1.28.0
    hooks:
      - id: yamllint
        name: yamllint
        description: runs yamllint
        entry: yamllint
        language: python
        types: [file, yaml]
        args: [--format, parsable, --strict]
```

## Linting & Build Pipelines

You can also add some check pipelines on your pull requests to ensure they are valid and conforming to your rules;
At minimal, you should have both a yaml linter and kustomize builder to ensure your code is valid; validating the Kubernetes ressources will be a good additional step, though it can be hard to juggle between CRDs versions.

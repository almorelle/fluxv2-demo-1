# Using Kustomize with flux

We've seen that to sync elements between git and the cluster, Flux was using two CRDs : `GitRepo`, and `Kustomization`.

The `Kustomization` CRD is used to do the apply of a specific path in the GitRepo; As its name suggest, it is using Kustomize to do the apply; If no `kustomization.yaml` exists at the root of the specified path, then Flux will generate one before the apply using `kustomize create --autodetect --recursive`.

What this means is you can use `kustomize` in your folders to reduce code duplication between environments.

# Helmreleases

Deploying applications on Kubernetes is often done using Helm. You can use Helm with flux by using its CRD "helmreleases", which basically defines a `helm upgrade --install` command as a Kubernetes object.

## Define a HelmRepository

First, we need to indicate to flux from which repository the helm you want to install will come from; this is done with the `HelmRepository` resource.

Let's create a `helmrepositories` folder at the root of the monitored folder to group these resources.
In it, define your first HelmRepository like so :

```yaml
# cat /base/helmrepositories/grafana-helmrepository.yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: grafana
spec:
  interval: 1h
  url: https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
```

Take care as to how you specify the `interval` parameter, which defines the interval between two `helm repo update` commands to update the helm index : for open-source repositories, once per hour is a good value, but for your own development repositories / environments you might want to decrease this value.

## Define a HelmRelease

Now that we have a HelmRepository, we can go and create our first HelmRelease:

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: grafana
spec:
  # interval between two charts reconciliations;
  # if chart.spec.interval is not defined, it's also the interval between two checks of the HelmRepository for updates.
  interval: 10m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: grafana # name of the chart to download;
      version: '6.32.9'
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: grafana
        namespace: default
```

It's often superfluous to have the interval in the HelmRelease greater to the one defined in the HelmRepository.

You can define the advanced behavior of the Helm deployment in this object :
```yaml
[...]
spec:
  dependsOn: [] # link to other HelmReleases that must be deployed before this one

  # parameters for the different helm lifecycle operations :
  install: {}
  upgrade: {}
  test: {}
  rollback: {}
  uninstall: {}

  # parameters for the helm installation / upgrade :
  values: {} # map of values to use for the helm install
  valuesFrom: [] # list of resources to use to populates the values (e.g. secrets)
  postRenderers: []

  suspend: false # disable the Helm reconciliation - useful when you're testing deployments manually.
```

The use of flux to install your helm releases will enable you to have both quicker deployment cycle and longer deployment time :
Since you're not manually deploying your helm release, you can afford to have longer Helm hooks and Helm tests, which will enable you to have a stabler application in your gitops deployment.

At the very least, I'd recommend for your helm releases of webapp to have a test of connectivity, to allow for a quick rollback if something went wrong (and if the k8s Deployment didn't catch that).
